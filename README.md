### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**aysenursahiin/aysenursahiin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on biology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and Biopython.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on biotechnology company.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help more information.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want.
